| Students | David Baumgartner and Albert Neuner | 
| Status | Finalizing bachelor thesis | 
| Description | All widely-known FaaS systems set up many design limitations (e.g., code size or memory assignment) and runtime limitations (e.g., size of input / output data, function duration, or hard disk size). The goal of this thesis is to develop a portable `jContainer` tool, which allows portable execution of FCs in multiple container systems, e.g., AWS Fargate or ECS.
|Tasks| 1. Develop a `jContainer` for multiple container systems.<br> 2. Integrate `jContainer` in *xAFCL EE*.<br> 3. Automatic container development and deployment of containers for multiple providers.<br> 4. Compose / adapt a real-life application that uses multiple cloud services.<br> 5. Evaluate `jContainer` with the real-life serverless applications across multiple container systems.|
