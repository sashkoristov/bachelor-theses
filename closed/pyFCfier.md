| Student | Mark Nardi | 
| Status | Finalizing bachelor thesis | 
| Description |  The goal of this thesis is to develop a portable Python FCfier (*pyFCfier*), which allows the FC developer to select the target FaaS system per serverless function, faasifies parts of the monolith as serverless fynctions across multiple FaaS systems, updates the offloaded code with the corresponding API calls converts Python monoliths as FCs and evaluate their scalability.|
|Tasks| 1. Develop a Python FCifier *pyFCfier* for multiple FaaS systems.<br> 2. Compose / adapt a monolith that uses multiple cloud services.<br> 3. Code annotation (per line) in Python to be FaaSified.<br> 4. Automatic package development and serverless function deployment of the faasified code.<br> 5. Evaluate the *pyFCfier* with real-life serverless applications.|
