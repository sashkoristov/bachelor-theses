| Description |  Development of serverless functions that use multiple cloud services is a complex task as it may require a huge development effort to integrate various libraries for each cloud service that the function uses. This thesis explores how to model cloud service types that a function uses in order to abstract them and offer a single interface with various methods for specific tasks. *fService* will be implemented to support various programming languages (e.g., Java, node.js, Python, etc.) and several cloud services (e.g., storage, object recognition, prediction, etc) of multiple cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Google, etc).
|Tasks| 1. Define interfaces and methods for various cloud services (e.g., storage, object recognition, prediction, etc). For instance, uploadFile(bucket), downloadFile(bucket). <br> 2. Develop implementations of interfaces for various cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Google, etc).<br> 3. Develop implementations of interfaces for various programming languages (e.g., Java, node.js, Python, etc).<br> 4. Build a portable FC for a real-life application with dynamic inputs of functions to specify the specific services that they use.<br> 5. Evaluate the system with real life applications and optimal selection of the proper cloud service.|
