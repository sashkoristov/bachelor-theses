| Students | David Freina and Jonas Wagner | 
| Description |  The goal of this thesis is to develop a portable Java FCfier (*jFCfier*), which allows the FC developer to annotate the target FaaS system per serverless function, faasifies parts of the Java monolith as serverless functions across multiple FaaS systems, updates the offloaded code with the corresponding API calls, converts Java monoliths as FCs, and evaluate their scalability. It is recommended to use the same annotation from our DAF tool (see our paper in the references).|
|Tentative tasks| 1. Develop a Java FCfier (*jFCfier*) for multiple FaaS systems.<br> 2. Compose / adapt a monolith that uses multiple cloud services.<br> 3. Code annotation (per line) in Java for FaaSification.<br> 4. Automatic package development and serverless function deployment of the faasified code.<br> 5. Evaluate the *jFCfier* with real-life serverless applications.|
