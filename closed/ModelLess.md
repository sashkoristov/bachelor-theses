| Description | Smart buildings have tens of thousands sensors and actuators in them. As a consequence, a massive IT infrastructure is required to collect and process enormous amount of data. Unfortunately, different parts of building automation work on different platforms, which causes interoperability issuess. This thesis builds a unified cloud-bases platform on Azure for creating building digital twins and support operations (including optimisations) of the building.| 
|Tasks| 1. build import Pipeline from IFC to Azure Digital twins (IFCtoRDF)<br> 2. Connect Sensor Edge Devices to Digital Twins for near real time sensor data (e.g. Energy consumption, Temperature) <br> 3. Use the Graph Query Language provided by AZDT to gather data for optimizer<br> 4. Build a wrapper for optimizer (e.g., JMetal) <br> 5. Feed optimisation steps back to Actuator Edge Devices<br> |
