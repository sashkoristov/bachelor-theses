| Description        | Integrating support for serverless cloud-based services can be quite hard and time consuming, especially to support multiple different cloud providers and to be able to switch between their services. The goal of this bachelor thesis is to extended the [CORE Java Library](https://github.com/FaaSTools/CORE) by adding support for Sentiment Analysis Services from different cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud and Azure). Additionally, the currently integrated services are going to be extended with the support for the new Provider Azure. Furthermore, the current implementation of the provider selection will be more flexible by adding a layer of abstraction, which gives rise to the possibility of implementing a custom provider selection strategy. Finally this bachelor thesis will evaluate whether the serverless cloud-based translation of texts has an influence on their sentiment and evaluate the advantages of using this library, such as LOC reduction and performance. |
| Tasks              | 1. Research the parameters and responses for the different providers for sentiment analysis. <br> 2. Research the currently supported services by the CORE Library and their implementations. <br> 3. Define the interface that will be offered to developers considering the existing services in the CORE Library. <br> 4. Integrate sentiment analysis service into the CORE Library <br> 5. Add support for Azure for all supported services <br> 6. Create a Layer of abstraction for provider selection to allow custom provider selection logic. <br> 7. Evaluate the benefits of the implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
