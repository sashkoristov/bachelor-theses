| Description |  Cloud simulation frameworks can simulate the behavior  of complex applications when being executed on cloud resources.  However, the simulators need to be configured with many parameters  which are not known by the users. Even a small inaccuracy in the  simulation may generate a huge discrepancy between the simulated and  real behavior. In this theses, the students will extend an existing  simulation framework to improve simulation accuracy based on  insights gained by real execution and performance measurements and  use the same application and resource setup for the simulation.|
|Tasks| 1. Extend the VolatileSim simulator with an execution module for DAX execution on AWS EC2.<br> 2. Measure performance of EC2 instances for various workflow application tasks.<br> 3. Configure the simulation framework with knowledge gained by  running workflows on EC2.<br> 4. Collect and analyse resulting data.|
