| Description | Selecting the optimal combination of cloud provider, serverless function configuration and storage solution remains a challenge due to the diverse offerings and lack of standardized interfaces across providers. This bachelor thesis addressed this challenge by measuring and analyzing the performance of serverless functions interacting with cloud storage services. Through empirical evaluation, including experiments with varying function memory configurations and storage providers, this study quantified upload and download times and derives insights using linear regression models. |
