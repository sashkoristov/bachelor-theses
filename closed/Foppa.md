| Description | Users need to select the cloud provider and the region where you want to host your functions. This causes a vendor lock-in effect, which services like pyStorage and xAFCL already try to avoid. In a dynamically changing environment, the execution of functions should adapt dynamically as well. To adapt to this dynamic environment in federated FaaS, this thesis develops Foppa. The objective is to observe the environment by scrutinizing the execution of current functions and arranging the subsequent functions based on the accumulated and revised knowledge. This methodology aims to identify the optimal execution environment by conveniently reducing it to a minimum in a few iterations. Foppa provides a single user interface for running and monitoring serverless functions. These functions can be executed statically with predefined settings or dynamically with automatically selected settings based on a predetermined optimization algorithm. These optimizers can focus on different topics, like execution time, throughput, or custom needs for custom problems. Foppa selects the provider and region. The primary objective of the system is to be scalable and resilient, which leads to the asynchronous microservice design decision. Moreover, the microservice architecture facilitates maintenance in the university setting, as updates and modifications can be applied to individual services.|
