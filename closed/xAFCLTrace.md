| Description | Running FCs across a heterogeneous environment may not be reproducible, which affects the accuracy and estimation of the FC behavior. The goal of this thesis is to develop an *xAFCLTrace* scheduling and tracing framework, which will emulate the FC execution based on some scheduling algorithm. The traces may be generated by a real execution or by external sources. FCs are built with the existing Abstract Function Choreography Language ([AFCL](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.08.012])) and run with the existing [xAFCL](https://github.com/sashkoristov/enactmentengine) enactment engine.|
|Tasks| 1. Compose / adapt a few real-life applications as FCs.<br> 2. Execute the composed FCs across multiple FaaS providers Log and trace the real FC execution.<br> 3. Develop a common interface AFCL -> Intermediary representation -> Scheduler (e.g., list-based) -> Intermediary representation -> Concrete Function Choreography Language (CFCL).<br> 4. Visualize the tracing.<br> 5. Evaluate various schedulers (cost/performance) with real execution.|
