| Description | The aim of this bachelor thesis is to conduct a series of experiments to profile various serverless workflow (FC) management systems of well-known public cloud providers. FCs may be tested for various configurations (concurrency, assigned memory, latency, region, programming language, etc). The times for the functions and FCs are measured and then evaluated. The measured data is stored in a database and then statistically evaluated and visualized. The aim of this work is a better understanding of serverless computing for different FCs and FaaS systems. The trade-off between performance and costs will be examined more closely. At the end, the optimal solution will be will be executed with the existing *xAFCL* enactment engine ([xAFCL EE](https://github.com/sashkoristov/enactmentengine)). 
|Tasks| 1. Develop serverless functions on various cloud providers. <br> 2. Develop FCs in various FC systems and in AFCL.<br> 3. Evaluate *FCs* with various workload and resources.<br> 4. Evaluate the optimal *FC* with xAFCL. |
