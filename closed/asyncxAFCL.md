| Description | All widely-known FaaS systems allow asynchronous invocation of serverless functions. The goal of this bachelor thesis is to develop the *aSync xAFCL EE* which will be able to enact *FCs* asynchronously across multiple FaaS systems.
|Tasks| 1. Review the existing workflow management systems (WMSs) that support asynchronous invocation.<br> 2. Analyze the behavior of FaaS systems over asynchronous invocation.<br> 3. Extend / revise asynchronous support in AFCL.<br> 4. Develop asynchronous invokers for well-known FaaS systems.<br> 5. Develop *aSync xAFCL EE* to support nested asynchronous invocation of (base and compound) functions.<br> 6. Evaluate the *async xAFCL EE* with asynchronous serverless workflows.|
