| Description | The objective of this thesis is to develop a cost-effective test environment for the performance analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) devices. The current solutions on the market for testing GNSS receivers are highly expensive and often do not allow for the testing of complete systems, including other hardware components such as antennas. In order to enable smaller businesses and facilitate overall system testing, a physical test station and the necessary software for performance analysis will be developed. This thesis is being conducted in collaboration with Netwake GmbH, and thus the software and hardware development builds on and integrates with Netwake's already existing architecture.|
