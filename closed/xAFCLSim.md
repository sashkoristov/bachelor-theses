| Description | Running highly scalable FCs may be a long running and costly operation. To analyze the application behavior with minimal execution time and costs, users prefer to use simulation. The goal of this bachelor thesis is to develop an *xAFCL* simulation framework, which will simulate the FC execution. The simulated values will be calculated based on a novel FaaS computing model. A dynamism will be added based on some known distributions. FCs are built with the existing [Abstract Function Choreography Language ([AFCL](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.08.012))] and run with the existing *xAFCL* enactment engine.|
|Tasks| 1. Compose / adapt a few real-life applications as FCs.<br> 2. Execute the composed FCs across multiple FaaS providers.<br> 3. Measure and profile the performance and cost of FCs.<br> 4. Model FCs and FaaS systems in *xAFCLSim*.<br> 5. Visualize the simulation.<br> 6. Evaluate the simulation (cost/performance/possibilities) with real execution.|
