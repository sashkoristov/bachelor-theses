| Description | The research topic of this study is the digitization in companies, especially the digitization of error catalogs for an efficient quality control. To address this topic, it is necessary to replace traditional paper-based error catalogs with web-based solutions. In order to significantly increase the input quality, verifications and plausibility queries are added. Additionally, the study examines the challenges and barriers that arise during digitization and explores the solutions and best practices to overcome them. |
