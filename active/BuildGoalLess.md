| Description | Modern buildings are managed with advanced technologies and systems. Such complex environment requires huge IT infrastructure to collect, store, and process large amount of data, which is also costly to maintain and scale. We introduce a serverless, goal-driven building automation system that helps reduce the amount of data transferred to the cloud by merging goal-driven scheduling and service family models. The thesis will use microservices-based architecture implemented with serverless computing. 
|Tasks| 1. Literature review. <br> 2. System architecture design.<br> 3. Develop state machines for building state management and for state transitions. <br> 4. Develop microservices at edge / cloud. <br> 5. Integrate data collection and various events and alerts. <br>6. Evaluate the system in terms of responsiveness and data transfer. |
