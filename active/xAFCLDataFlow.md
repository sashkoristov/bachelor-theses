| Student | Andreas Reheis | 
| Status | Development | 
| Description | The goal of this thesis is to facilitate the development of FCs with data-flow between abstract function types. After development, the system will convert the abstract into concrete data-flow during runtime.|
|Tasks| 1. Graphical development of FC data-flow considering data ports interoperbility and integration with AFCL meta-data database.<br> 2. Convert abstract to concrete data-flow.<br> 3. Data-flow managament (e.g., merge data inputs/outputs, passing data, sub-objects, super-objects, DAG-based data-flow, data-flow through compound functions, ...).<br> 4. Automatic generation of AFCL/CFCL code.<br> 5. Evaluate the converted data-flow with a representative FC.|
