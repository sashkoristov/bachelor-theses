| Student | Hannes Stecher | 
| Description | This thesis investigates the design, implementation and evaluation of function-driven, graph-based distributed algorithms expressed as fine-grained functions and executed on serverless platforms. By leveraging the elasticity and scalability of serverless computing, it explores the necessary routines and mechanisms required for successful orchestration and state-management.|
| Tasks | 1. Build a library of graph-based algorithms (e.g. Bellman-Ford) as serverless functions <br> 2. Orchestrate functions and data sharding to support parallelism <br> 3. Evaluate throughput, latency and cost under varying invocation patterns<br> 4. Compare against state-of-the-art approaches. | 
| Theoretical skills | Federated clouds, Distributed algorithms. | 
| Practical skills | APIs, programming.|
