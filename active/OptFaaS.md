| Description | All top cloud providers offer Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) service in which their users may run their serverless applications. However, the process of selecting the appropriate cloud provider in terms of performance and cost may be a tedious and expensive operation because various factors affect the function runtime. This bachelor thesis will develop OptFaaS, a benchmarking suite that predicts the function runtime across various cloud providers in federated FaaS. The benchmarking suite will consider various parameters, such as memory, concurrency, programming languages, warm/cold start, etc. OptFaaS will collect data for various benchmarking functions and then predict their and the performance of other functions across multiple regions in Federated FaaS. The thesis will explore various ML techniques that are suitable for this problem.|
|Tasks| 1. Research existing and use own functions for benchmarking.<br> 2. Setup the OptFaaS benchmarking environment across two cloud providers (e.g., AWS and Google). <br> 3. Run benchmarking to collect data for different periods of time within a day and different days of the week, including various performance-based parameters.<br> 4. Validate various ML techniques for the benchmarked functions.<br> 5. Evaluate the ML techniques for the new functions.<br> 6. Develop an interface to access OptFaaS (e.g., as a service).|
