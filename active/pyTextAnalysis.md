| Description | Integrating multiple serverless cloud services can be a time-consuming task, as developers need to compare features, performance, and pricing to select the optimal provider for their needs. This bachelor thesis aims to extend fService by developing a Python library that abstracts multiple text analysis services from different cloud providers (e.g., AWS and Google). Furthermore, based on heuristics such as feature set and performance benchmarks, the services will dynamically select the most appropriate cloud provider for each specific analysis task. |
| Tasks | 1. Research the supported features parameter of various cloud providers. <br> 2. Define the interfaces that will be offered to developers. <br> 3. Profile various parameters of text analysis services of cloud providers, such as performance, cost, accuracy, etc. <br> 4. Develop the interoperable library with heuristics for federated clouds <br> 5. Evaluate the benefits of *pyTextAnalysis*. |
