| Description | The goal of this bachelor thesis is to build an application that determines the costs of a digital twin based on the user needs and aims to deploy this digital twin on federated cloud providers.<br>Within this approach the costs of services on a single cloud provider need to be analyzed, followed by inspecting which services of cloud providers can work interoperable or if it is necessary to first migrate to the other cloud provider while staying within the same layer. Afterwards the cheapest solution based on the initial analysis should be deployed on federated cloud providers. |
| Tasks       | 1. Analyzing costs of services used by the digital twin on single cloud providers (e.g.: AWS, Microsoft Azure, etc.).<br>2. Analyze features and constraints of cloud providers services to determine portability or interoperability of different components / layers.<br>3. Deploying the cheapest solution on federated cloud providers based on previous analysis.|
