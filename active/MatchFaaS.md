| Student | Andrei Amza | 
| Description | The goal of this bachelor thesis is to develop a scheduler that optimizes makespan of serverless workflows or function choreographies (FCs) to run them across multiple regions in federated FaaS. The scheduler will use matching algorithm between FC functions and various cloud regions in federated FaaS to determine the optimal setup where to run each function. The scheduler will be evaluated with real life FCs. |
