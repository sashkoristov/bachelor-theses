| Description |  Running highly scalable FCs may be a long running and costly operation. Recently, I supervised the bachelor thesis "*xAFCLSim* simulation framework" in which the initial version of the xAFCL simulator was integrated in xAFCL enactment engine, which assumes compute intensive serverless functions. The goal of this bachelor thesis is to develop *xAFCLSim2* simulation framework, which will support simulation of serverless functions that use cloud services (e.g., cloud storage), which can be dynamically selected as input to the functions. A dynamism will be added based on some known distributions. FCs are built with the existing [Abstract Function Choreography Language ([AFCL](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.08.012)) and run with the existing *xAFCL* enactment engine ([xAFCL EE](https://github.com/sashkoristov/enactmentengine)), in which *xAFCLSim2* will be integrated into. *xAFCLSim2* will be evaluated with real life functions for various FaaS providers and abstracted cloud services. The main target will be to simulate the round trip time of, for instance, a serverless function that runs in AWS Frankfurt and downloads the input file from AWS S3 Tokyo and stores the output file in Google Cloud Storage in Belgium if we have executed the same function implementation on any AWS region (not on another provider) with any storage location for input and output files (even on Google storage).
|Tasks| 1. Compose / adapt a few sample benchmark applications as FCs.<br> 2. Measure and profile the performance and cost of serverless infrastructure for parameter setup.<br> 3. Model FCs and FaaS systems and integrate them into *xAFCLSim2* as a module in *xAFCL*.<br> 4. Visualize the simulation.<br> 5. Evaluate the simulation (cost/performance/possibilities) with real execution.|
