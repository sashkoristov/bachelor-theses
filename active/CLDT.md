| Description | The objective of this thesis is to design and implement a cloud-based, multi-provider digital twin using service from AWS and Azure. It aims to identify potential challenges associated with such an architecture and propose effective solutions.
The work begins by clarifying the specific type of digital twin being developed and outlining the different architectural layers it comprises.
Once the digital twin is clearly defined, the focus shifts to the deployment of the necessary cloud services that form its foundation.
Subsequently, the work examines the data flow between the layers, analyzing how information is exchanged and integrated within the system. Special attention is given to the complexities that arise when switching providers at various architectural levels.|
