| Description | Function-as-a-Service paradigm hides all administrative and maintenance activities and allow developers to deploy their codes in form of serverless functions. However, developers are challenged to select the appropriate cloud providers not only for their serverless functions, but also for various mangaged Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) cloud services that a serverless function will use. In this thesis, students will develop a system that will simplify development of serverless functions that use managed cloud services. By selecting a set of BaaS services of specific providers, the system will generate a template Java code, including annotations for benchmarking. After coding the function, the system will deploy and perform performance benchmarks to determine the optimal provider for the function and BaaS service (where applicable) |
|Tasks| 1. Extend jFops with code snippets for various BaaS services and providers, including interoperable fService libraries.<br> 2. Define annotations and automatic code injection to extract BaaS service runtime. <br> 3. Store and reuse results from benchmarks.<br> 4. Integrate jFops with TestOps (automatic creation of test configuration<br> 5. Evaluate the system with some real life serverless functions and BaaS services.<br>|
