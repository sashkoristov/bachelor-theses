| Description | Each cloud provider offers their own services for specific needs of the users. For instance, for storing objects, Amazon and Google have has AWS S3 Storage and Google Cloud Storage, respectively, while for object recognition in images, they introduced AWS Rekognition and Google Vision. In order to unlock the users in federated clouds, the novel fService approach offers developers to create serverless functions with interoperable services. With this approach, users can freely select varios services. For instance, run computing on AWS Lambda while images are stored on Google Cloud Storage and processed with AWS Rekognition. The goal of this bachelor thesis is to develop and characterize serverless applications that can easily select cloud services during runtime. The FCs will be developed using our Abstract Function Choreography Language ([AFCL](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.08.012)). A series of experiments will be conducted to determine pros and cons of mixing computing and cloud services among various providers (e.g., Amazon and Google). The target is to characterize how various interoperable services affect performance and cost for various problem size. For the experiments, the *xAFCL* enactment engine [*xAFCL EE*](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2021.3128137) will be used. The final goal is to determine the fastest and cheapest setup for the evaluated FCs.|
