| Students | one or two | 
| Description | After coding a serverless function, there are two important steps of the serverless function - packaging and deployment, which may take significant time. In this bachelor thesis, students will analyze how the package size and deployment time of functions are affected by various package dependencies inside the function for different providers. For packaging, students may use jfOps (result of another bachelor thesis) for automatic creation of Java functions and the existing benchmarking tool [TestOps](https://github.com/FaaSTools/testOps) (result of another bachelor thesis) to automatize experiments to collect data about deployment time of functions in any programming language. Students can select their preferred programming language (Python, Java, Node.js, or Go). Various cloud services should be benchmarked, individually or together, as well as deployment across various regions. Students should create a mathematical model for the package size of a function for different providers, based on the services that the function uses. Each service will increase the package size with some KB/MB. The model estimates the package size of a function with different services, which we have not coded yet. Based on the package size, the student will measure the deployment time and using a regression function to model the deployment time.
|Tasks| 1. Develop benchmarking functions with different cloud services for different cloud providers and measure their package size. <br> 2. Develop scripts for TestOps for deployment and benchmarking deployment time of the developed functons.<br> 3. Develop the mathematical model. <br> 4. Evaluate accuracy of the model for other cloud services that were not used for learning. <br> 6. (Optional) Apply the mathematical model in our simulator SimLess to be able to simulate deployment time of a function, apart from its execution time.|
