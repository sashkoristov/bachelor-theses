Repository for available, active and closed topics for Bachelor theses in the context of the class “Seminar mit Bachelorarbeit”


As a result of several bachelor and master theses that I supervised, as well as our own research, we have developed a prototype of the *xAFCL* enactment engine, which is able to run serverless workflows or function choreographies (*FCs*) across many widely-known cloud providers (AWS Lambda, IBM Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Functions, Alibaba Function Compute, Microsoft Azure Cloud Functions, etc.)

The following paragraphs present the available and recently started bachelor theses directly connected with the AFCL Environment.


# Available bachelor theses

The following topics for bachelor theses are available for the summer semester 2021:
* Tentative start February-March 2021
* Tentative finish June-December 2021


## 1. Prtable Java FCfier

## 2. xContainer

Develop invokers to other compute end points - e.g. AWS ECS, Fargate, Docker, Kubernetes, Fission, OpenWhisk ... This will allow xAFCL to run not only serverless functions, but also functions in a container and on some open source FaaS frameworks.

## 3. AFCL vs-code IntelliSense

Build the FC with the code, but with intelligent proposal to fill the code.


# Recently started bachelor theses for the AFCL Environment)

## 1. *xAFCL* simulation framework

| Title | ***xAFCL* simulation framework** |
| ----- | ----- | 
| Student | Mika Hautz | 
| Description | Running highly scalable FCs may be a long running a costly operation and in order to mitigate costs, users prefer to use simulation. The goal of this thesis is to develop an *xAFCL* simulation framework, which will simulate the FC execution. The simulated values will be calculated based on a novel computing model. FCs are built with the existing [Abstract Function Choreography Language ([AFCL](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.08.012))] and run with the existing *xAFCL* enactment engine.
|Tasks| - Compose / adapt a few real-life applications as FCs - Execute the composed FCs across multiple FaaS providers Measure and profile the performance and cost of FCs. Model FCs and FaaS systems in the AFCL Environment simulation framework. Visualize the simulation. Evaluate the simulation (cost/performance/possibilities) with real execution.|

## 2. *xAFCL* scheduling and tracing framework

| Title | ***xAFCL* scheduling and tracing framework** |
| ----- | ----- | 
| Student | Mika Hautz | 
| Description | Running FCs across such a heterogeneous environment may not be reproducible, which affects te accuracy and estimation of the FC execution. The goal of this thesis is to develop an *xAFCL* scheduling and tracing framework, which will emulate the FC execution based on some schedling algorithm. The traces may be generated by a real execution or by external source. FCs are built with the existing [Abstract Function Choreography Language ([AFCL](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.08.012))] and run with the existing *xAFCL* enactment engine.
|Tasks| - Compose / adapt a few real-life applications as FCs - Execute the composed FCs across multiple FaaS providers Log and trace the real FC execution. Develop a common interface AFCL -> Intermediary representation -> Scheduler (e.g., list-based) -> Intermediary representation -> Concrete Function Choreography Language (CFCL). Visualize the tracing. Evaluate various schedulers (cost/performance) with real execution.|

## 3. Portable Python FCifier

| Title | **Portable Python FCifier** |
| ----- | ----- | 
| Student | Mark Nardi | 
| Description |  The goal of this thesis is to develop a portable Python FCfier, which allows the FC developer to select the target FaaS system per serverless function, faasifies parts of the monolith as serverless fynctions across multiple FaaS systems, updates the offloaded code with the corresponding API calls converts Python monoliths as FCs and evaluate their scalability. 
|Tasks| - Compose / adapt a monolith that uses multiple cloud services - ...|
