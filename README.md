# Bachelor theses (Supervisor: Sashko Ristov)

A repository for available, active and closed topics for bachelor theses in the context of the class “Seminar mit Bachelorarbeit”. Supervisor - Dr. Sashko Ristov.

<!--
As a result of several bachelor and master theses that I supervised, we have developed a prototype of the *xAFCL* enactment engine [*xAFCL EE*](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2021.3128137), which is able to run serverless workflows or function choreographies (*FCs*) across many widely-known cloud providers. *xAFCL EE* integrates the component [FTjFaaS](https://github.com/sashkoristov/FTjFaaS) for optional fault tolerant execution of FC functions (currently supported AWS Lambda and IBM Cloud Functions) and [jFaaS](https://github.com/sashkoristov/jFaaS/) for portable execution across many FaaS systems (AWS Lambda, IBM Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Functions, Alibaba Function Compute, Microsoft Azure Cloud Functions, etc).

*xAFCL EE* is the core part of the [AFCL Environment](https://github.com/sashkoristov/AFCLEnvironment), a platform to develop, deploy, and fault tolerant execution of FCs developed in our Abstract Function Choreography Language ([AFCL](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.08.012)).

The following paragraphs present the available bachelor theses for the following winter semester 2023/24. 

You can find a latex template for the bachelor thesis which includes some hints [here](https://github.com/sashkoristov/bachelor-theses/tree/main/template).

Each topic can be adapted for a single student or a group of two students.
